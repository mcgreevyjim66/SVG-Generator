# SVG-Generator

## Description


This project will build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a `.svg` file.

This command line app will quickly and easily create a SVG file by using a command-line application to generate one. 

This app will create a command-line application that dynamically generates an SVG file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

The application will also test the render function for each of the available logo shapes using jest.
